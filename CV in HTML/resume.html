            HOBBIES :
        </h2></dt>
         <dd>
            Different people have different hobbies based on their taste and preferences. Some like swimming, some dancing and some prefer to read a book in isolation. One thing I like to do is to walk in the woods in silence and calm. I could say that it is a hobby of mine.
         <br><br>
         I like to walk as close to the nature as possible. It just feels so good that my heart always crave for a walk through the forest, park or any landscape that has been untouched from human interference. Walking fills my lungs with clean, fresh air and gives me a new lease of life.
         <br> <br>also my favourite hoobie is cricket. i watch cricket matches and play as well.
         Cricket is my hobby and my passion. I have been playing cricket since I was a young boy, and I have always enjoyed the thrill and excitement of the game. I find cricket to be a challenging and rewarding sport, and it brings me a great sense of satisfaction and enjoyment.
         <br><br>
         One of the reasons I love cricket is that it is a team sport. I enjoy working together with my teammates to achieve a common goal, and I find that the camaraderie and team spirit of cricket is unparalleled. I also enjoy the strategic and tactical aspects of the game and the challenges of outwitting and outmaneuvering the opposition.
